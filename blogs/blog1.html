    <h1>Importance of Sleep</h1>
    <p>September 23, 2021</p>
    <img class="blog-img" src="/images/sleep.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Sleep helps us rejuvenate our energy and lets us start a new day fresh. Why do we need to sleep? Why do we  need to sleep for 8 hours a day. Why can’t we sleep less and work more?.</p>
        <p>
        These are some of the questions that we encounter everyday. We feel like sleeping less increases our productivity but that's not the case. According to the life cycle of a human being, newborns tend to sleep around 14-16 hours a day. As we grow old, the need for sleep becomes less, around 9-12 hours for 8-12 years old and around 8-10 hours for teenagers.
    </p>

    <h2>Lack of sleep:</h2> 

    <p>As we become an adult, we get busy with our work and hectic schedule, so we feel sleeping less will make our job done but that is not the case. Sleeping less than 7-8 hours a day means a decrease in concentration. This also disrupts hormone levels which makes us feel hungry. Lack of Sleep leads to cardiac problems, obesity, poor immunity, vision related issues. Less Sleep over a longer period will hinder confidence levels and decision making ability. You may even feel lethargic and sleepy during the day.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>So, it is necessary to get adequate sleep during the night, maintaining a schedule is the best way to get enough sleep. We must stay away from electronic devices before going to sleep as it emits blue light which suppresses our sleep. Taking a bath is also good before going to sleep as it cools down the body. Also if it is possible taking a short nap in the evening is also good as it refreshes the body. Taking adequate sleep everyday will lead towards a healthy and happy life.
